# GenAi_Genisis

Welcome to my Generative AI playground. This repository is a personal space where I document my exploration and experimentation with GenAI technologies.

The main purpose of this repository is to:
- Track and showcase my learning progress in the field of Generative AI.
- Share simple projects, code snippets, and ideas as I gain hands-on experience.
- Explore practical implementations of GenAI concepts in text, image, and multimodal generation.

NB : This is not meant to be a tutorial or guide for others , but rather a portfolio of experiments and progress as I continue learning.
